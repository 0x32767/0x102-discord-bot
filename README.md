## license

A large amount of commands in this bot are from other bots, there for the license of the bot is https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html. This is because the copy write owner (of the original repository from the bot I have taken some of the commands from) `GeoffreyWesthoff` (https://github.com/GeoffreyWesthoff/Dank-Memer#license) says so in his license section. Full credit goes to the original author(s). Files that contain the MIT license are 100% free to use (as they are from me). Licensing information will be available in all files in the cogs directory as this is were all of the commands are, no other code was used any were else in the bot. The verification of these files can be found by looking at previous commits to the repo.

Also fro clarity, the license of the bot is the AGPLv3 license. And when the license refers to "this Software" it refers to the file.
