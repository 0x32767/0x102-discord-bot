# 0x102 discord bot

> Overview

0x102 is a discord bot packed with many features, It is made with the discord.py library (which has resumed development). The discord bot is still under development and is being frequently updated.

## public use

The bot is currently not available for public use yet, if you want it to release then star the project. When the bot will launch for public use the bot (0x102) will be 0x012, that way the 0x102 bot can still be used for development. (There will be two versions of the bot, one for use, one for testing).

## updates

The bot is being frequently updated, progress graph can be found here: https://github.com/0x32767/0x102-discord-bot/graphs/contributors.

## contributing

Pull requests will be accepted by the author, these pull requests can range from spreeing errors to refactoring the whole project (if you are crazy enough to :) ). Another feature of this bot is custom commands, these commands will need to be verified and can be submitted via the bot or a pull request to the repo (these will need to be approved of though).
