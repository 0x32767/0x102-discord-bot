># Overview

The 0x102 Discord bot is a discord bot written with the discord.py api wrapper. The bot is written in python and has been a project for the last year. The discord bot has now largely been discontinued due to lack of ideas and atention.

># Fetures

The bot is desighned to be a utility bot with fetures such as:
 * Trivia
 * Moderation
 * Economy
 * APIs
 * Minecraft
 * Wikapedia

Most of these fetures have been largely complete, however the bot will hopefully include:
 * Kahoot-like trivia quizes
 * The ability to trade a server spicific curency betwene servers
 * Todo function

The fetures will hopefully be added when the bot is recontinued.

># Resons for less activity

The programer is still in school and has dedicated much of his day to other activities. The school has also blocked discord making it impossible to test the bot for bugs and other problems.
