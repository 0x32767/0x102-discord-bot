# 0x102 discord bot

> Overview

0x102 is a discord bot packed with many features, It is made with the discord.py library (which has resumed development). The discord bot is still under development and is being frequently updated.

## public use

The bot is currently not available for public use yet, if you want it to release then star the project. When the bot will launch for public use the bot (0x102) will be 0x012, that way the 0x102 bot can still be used for development. (There will be two versions of the bot, one for use, one for testing).

## updates

The bot is being frequently updated, progress graph can be found here: https://github.com/0x32767/0x102-discord-bot/graphs/contributors.

## contributing

Pull requests will be accepted by the author, these pull requests can range from spreeing errors to refactoring the whole project (if you are crazy enough to :) ). Another feature of this bot is custom commands, these commands will need to be verified and can be submitted via the bot or a pull request to the repo (these will need to be approved of though).

## license

A large amount of commands in this bot are from other bots, there for the license of the bot is https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html. This is because the copy write owner (of the original repository from the bot I have taken some of the commands from) `GeoffreyWesthoff` (https://github.com/GeoffreyWesthoff/Dank-Memer#license) says so in his license section. Full credit goes to the original author(s). Files that contain the MIT license are 100% free to use (as they are from me). Licensing information will be available in all files in the cogs directory as this is were all of the commands are, no other code was used any were else in the bot. The verification of these files can be found by looking at previous commits to the repo.

Also fro clarity, the license of the bot is the AGPLv3 license. And when the license refers to "this Software" it refers to the file.
