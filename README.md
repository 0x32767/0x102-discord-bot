# 0x102 discord bot

> Overview

0x102 is a discord bot packed with many features, It is made with the discord.py library (which has resumed development). The discord bot is still under development and is being frequently updated.

## public use

The bot is currently not available for public use yet, if you want it to release then star the project. When the bot will launch for public use the bot (0x102) will be 0x012, that way the 0x102 bot can still be used for development. (There will be two versions of the bot, one for use, one for testing).

## updates

The bot is being frequently updated, progress graph can be found here: https://github.com/0x32767/0x102-discord-bot/graphs/contributors.

## contributing

Pull requests will be accepted by the author, these pull requests can range from spreeing errors to refactoring the whole project (if you are crazy enough to :) ). Another feature of this bot is custom commands, these commands will need to be verified and can be submitted via the bot or a pull request to the repo (these will need to be approved of though).

## Release

There are several things that hold the bot back from being released, they mainly spring from the project not being funded or genorating any money. This stops making a website and getting a host for the bot. If the bot starts to genorate money or is funded, then hosting will be a prioraty.

### payed or free

I want 0x102 to be a free disocord bot, however with many hosts dropping their free teer, including:
- Mongo DB
- Heroku
For those reasons the bot will require payment for more resource intensive features. (The following sentences are elaboration) Most services price their clients by how much hardwear is required to run the code or something similar. Because the bot is programed with this in min the bot is created to be as resource efficiant and fast as possible. This makes the bot cheep to keep online and fast. This means that as the bot gains popularity, the money created by the bot will go into renting better heardwear. If there is still large profit I will look at making some features of the bot free or cheeper.

### Hopes of the future

As the project becomes more popular I want to see if I can ccolaborate with other discord bots, dankmemer for example is the most popular discord bot which has its own economy system. I would want to try the get the Dankmemer team to create an api, because Dankmemer currently has no public api or api at all.
