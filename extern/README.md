# Dis language

## Introduction

The Dis or discord language is used for creating custom commands, this has been atempted before by me with JPL but was never successfull. The lanugage can not be executed by 0x102 yet but is still be experimented with. The language is still in developement andcan be close to anything, however for the time being it is functional with no OOP featues intended, a high level language similar to dart and C#, but still will use typeanotations for ease of developement, however this is optional like python.

## Syntax

The language follows many conventions of other lanugages however does have some very distin diferences.

### Functions

Functions are defined in the following syntax:

```
fnc FunctionName(argument1, argument2, ... ) [
    // Inner Code
];
```

Functions can also return a value this is used with the `return` keyword
