# How so I join the 0x102 team?

## Requirements

- knowledge of programing terminology and concepts
- knows what discord is and how to use it
- can use git or github / github desktop
- python experience (6 months minimum)
- can edit code on a frequent basis
- can read and write markdown
- asynchronous programming
- use of discord.py

## Day to day work

So the development of the bot is not an extremely formal task. Developers are prompted to work on the bot as frequently as possible. Schooling (if you are a student) would get in the way, however you are asked to make one beneficial edit to the bot at least one every two weeks.

## expectations

As previously mentioned, devs are asked to work on the bot as frequently as possible, without interrupting your regular workflow too much. You would also be asked to make beneficial edits to the bot that would not harm the bot's functionality, such as not following a license. You are also asked to be respectful of the bot's community and the other developers to create a positive and zen environment.

### Documenting

It is very important that you document the changes you make, this is because part of the bot's community is about transparency and documentation. Therefor unless the changes are minor (such as fixing spelling errors) a pull request to the master branch should be well documented.

## Joining the 0x102 team

To join the team you would need to upload a pull request to the master branch that follows the guidelines as much as possible. e.g you could upload a pr that adds a new command to the bot and if it satisfies the requirements you would be given the link to the support server and given elevated privileges.

## Why did I not get a link to the support server?

If you did not get a link then you either did not follow the guidelines close enough, or the contribution was not game breaking enough. These details should be explained in the pr response.

## Getting booted from the team

Even though the team is not an official organization, devs who do not give a positive outlook on the general public would be removed from the team. This is because the team would not want to be associated with users who do not give a positive outlook on the general public, e.g offensive messages or swearing will not be tolerated. If you are not happy with the bot or the direction it is going then do tell us why you are not happy. If you need a break from the team you can ask for one, we would rather have all of our devs resting rather than exhausted.
