# Styling Guidelines

As a team we want to follow the zen of python and the pep8 guidelines.

The zen of python goes as follows:

```
The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than _right_ now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
```

# styling

We would recommend using the black formatter for your code.

1. All files should have one blank line at the end of each file.
2. All imports should be at the top of the file and be sorted by character length.
3. All variables should be annotated with their type.
4. Tabs should be 4 spaces long.
5. Lines can not be longer than 127 characters.
6. No trailing whitespace.
7. No trailing blank lines.
8. Use with statements when possible.
