## [06c69a5] refactored code for pycharm

Pycharm is an editor that is very powerful, however I use vscode or vim or emacs every once in a while, because pycharm is going to be an editor that my piers would use, I have refactored the code so that it would give as little warnings as possible.

## [73845b7] Change file names.

changed the names of imported files from CamelCase to snake_case, this also help to keep pycharm warnings and suggestions at a minimum.

#### Next:

Add a tone of documentation and `TODO`s to the files. This would help to explain the code better, and what would be needed to be done.

## [] Add TODOs and docs

I have added documentation for the important parts and most of the files in the `cogs` folder.

### Next:
Organize all the files beginning with an underscore ( this guy `_` ) into folders in the cogs dir.
