## [06c69a5] refactored code for pycharm

Pycharm is an editor that is very powerful, however I use vscode or vim or emacs every once in a while, because pycharm is going to be an editor that my piers would use, I have refactored the code so that it would give as little warnings as possible.

## [73845b7] Change file names.

changed the names of imported files from CamelCase to snake_case, this also help to keep pycharm warnings and suggestions at a minimum.

#### Next:

Add a tone of documentation and `TODO`s to the files. This would help to explain the code better, and what would be needed to be done.

## [df3c0ec] Add TODOs and docs

I have added documentation for the important parts and most of the files in the `cogs` folder.

### Next:

Organize all the files beginning with an underscore ( this guy `_` ) into folders in the cogs dir.

## [3765ecd] sort most of the `_` files

I have sorted the files prefixed with a `_` into their own folders being:

- custom_commands
- ui

#### Next:

get some todos ticked off or add some in.

## [] Add more features

I have added a stackoverflow command so you can search for stackoverflow stuff.
Fixed the most frustrating problem where slash commands would not load in properly.
Regular commands work with the `-` prefix, those will be added later.

## Next:

- users can play blackjack or one armed bandit, basically the gamboling system but they won't have anything to lose.
