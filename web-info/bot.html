        bot is also part of a chain of discord bots created by the <b>DBC</b> (discord bot corporation). All bots that have been made by the DBC are
        and will still be made by their owners. All that the DBC does is connect the bots together to a database to improve the user's experience.

    <h2>Custom Commands</h2>
    <div id="custom-commands">
        Custom commands are written in a programing language called lua. The developer chose lua because it is a simple language that is easy to learn.
        it is also roblox's language of choice when it comes to creating games. These commands are written to a file called <a href="">commands.lua</a>.
        The commands are public by default, however the commands will need to meet a strict standard to be made public.
        <br>
        To make a command you start by using <b>/newcommand</b> a modal wil popup which will prompt you to enter the program for the command. When you
        are finished you can submit the code and click the <b>save</b> button on a message sent to you. This will send the command to a database where
        it will be stored. These commands can be used publicly immediately.
        <br>
        Commands can also be part of the bot if a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests">github pul request</a> is sent. The command would then be part of the
        bot and can be used in any server (without having to reload the page or anything else).
        <br>
        <h3>Command standards</h3>
        custom commands can currently not use the <b>require</b> function. This is because if it could the bot would be unsecure. The command context
        is also very restricted. The command only gives access to be able to respond to messages in plain text, and get the name of the command user.
        <br>
        <h3>Future support</h3>
        The developer will start implementing features into the api, e.g more command context (less restrictions) and embed and modal support, as well
        as ui and api support.
